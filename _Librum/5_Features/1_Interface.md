Librum makes a few changes to the default user interface, aiming to create a unique visual experience and improve the VR experience. For visual enhancements, Librum utilizes [SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604) along with the excellent [Dear Diary UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23010) and elements of the [Adventurer Theme Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35568). This combination blends a Skyrim-style modern UI with touches of a more Oblivion-style classic visual theme:

We understand that UIs, HUDs, Fonts, and ENBs are highly subjective choices, so as of version 2.0, we've started to delve into providing bundled options. The Font Selector allows you to switch between several different font options, and there are two distinct HUD presets. More options are planned for future releases to cater to a variety of preferences.
